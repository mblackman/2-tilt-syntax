# 2-tilt-syntax theme

This is the matching theme to my ui theme. The focus of these themes is to focus the theme on
a 4 shade gradient between 2 colors. I like a simple and customizable theme to my IDEs. So
if you look at the \\styles\\colors.less file you can edit c00 and c11 and the entire theme will
adjust to a gradient between those colors.

The idea between c00..c11 is c00 and c11 are the true colors on the gradient.
c10 is 67% c11 and 33% c00
c01 is 33% c11 and 67% c00
